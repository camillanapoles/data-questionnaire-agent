# Data Wellness Q&A Chatbot

This is a reverse chatbot that asks the users questions about data integration practices and then gives advice based on a body of knowledge.
This version operates a bit like an agent which tries to gather enough information to be able to give advice. So it may ask an unspecified number of questions.

We have used a specially changed version of the [Chainlit][https://chainlit.io] library that you can install from the wheels folder.

The source code for the hacked chainlit version is from this repo:

https://github.com/onepointconsulting/chainlit-data-wellness-agent.git

## Setup

We suggest to use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage the virtual environment and then install poetry.

```
conda activate base
conda remove -n data_integration_questionnaire_agent --all
conda create -n data_integration_questionnaire_agent python=3.11
conda activate data_integration_questionnaire_agent
pip install poetry
```

## Installation

```
poetry install
poetry add --editable ./wheels/chainlit-0.7.8.10-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Running

### Prepare the SQLLite database

Before you run for the first time, please run this command from the command line to initiate the SQLLite database:

```
python ./data_questionnaire_agent/utils/tracker_db_init.py
```

### Running the main application

```
chainlit run .\data_questionnaire_agent\ui\data_questionnaire_chainlit.py --port 8080
```

## Configuration

This is the content of the `.env` file, which needs to be saved in the project root folder.

## Note on sqllite3 on Windows

If you have a hard time installing sqllite3 on Windows follow these instructions:

https://zeljic.com/blog/sqlite-lib-windows-10/

1. Download source from [source](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)

	For example: [source](https://www.sqlite.org/2023/sqlite-amalgamation-3430100.zip) `https://www.sqlite.org/2023/sqlite-amalgamation-3430100.zip`
2. Download binary from [binary](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)

	For example: [binary](https://www.sqlite.org/2023/sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3430100.zip) `https://www.sqlite.org/2023/sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3430100.zip`
    
3. Extract both archives to the same directory
    
4. Open **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017** by typing *Developer Command* in Windows Search

5. Go to directory where you've extracted **source code** and **binary** files (via opened cmd)
6. Run 
	```lib /DEF:sqlite3.def /OUT:sqlite3.lib /MACHINE:x64```
7. Copy all of the files including `sqlite3.h` into one of the include folders used by `cl.exe` like e.g. `-IC:\Users\gilfe\miniconda3\envs\data_integration_questionnaire_agent\Include`
